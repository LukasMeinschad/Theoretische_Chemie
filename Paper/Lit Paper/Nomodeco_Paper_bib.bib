  abstract = {Methodological progress is reported in the challenging direction of a black-box-type variational solution of the (ro)vibrational Schrödinger equation applicable to floppy, polyatomic systems with multiple large-amplitude motions. This progress is achieved through the combination of (i) the numerical kinetic-energy operator (KEO) approach of Mátyus et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 130, 134112 (2009)] and (ii) the Smolyak nonproduct grid method of Avila and Carrington, Jr. [J. Chem. Phys. 131, 174103 (2009)]. The numerical representation of the KEO makes it possible to choose internal coordinates and a body-fixed frame best suited for the molecular system. The Smolyak scheme reduces the size of the direct-product grid representation by orders of magnitude, while retaining some of the useful features of it. As a result, multidimensional (ro)vibrational states are computed with system-adapted coordinates, a compact basis- and grid-representation, and an iterative eigensolver. Details of the methodological developments and the first numerical applications are presented for the CH4·Ar complex treated in full (12D) vibrational dimensionality.},

Use of a proposed set of extra-redundant internal coordinates is shown to reduce the number of geometry steps significantly relative to the use of redundant coordinates. Various update schemes are tested for minimum and saddle-point optimizations, including combination formulas. The complete expressions for the first and second derivatives of the Wilson B matrix are presented, thereby avoiding the need to calculate this by finite-difference methods.

Emphasis is made on the high frequency OH stretching band and the so-called connectivity band that lies in the far infrared region. The substructures of the two infrared bands are analyzed in terms of different levels of connectivity of the water molecules, along the statements of the percolation model. Both band profiles appear to be related to the different degrees of connectivity of water molecules. Comparison of the data with the predictions of the percolation model shows good agreement as for the temperature evolution of liquid water. This work provides additional support to the interpretation of water bands substructures as signatures of its very specific connectivity pattern.},

  abstract = {A method for predicting splittings and shifts of bands in infrared spectra of small clusters of polyatomic molecules is presented. Based on an approach of early publications of Buckingham, the influence of the intermolecular forces on the vibrational energy levels of the constituent molecules is calculated using perturbation theory to second order. In order to describe the interaction of identical molecules, this ansatz is extended to also cover degenerate systems. In first order, a coupling of the vibrational modes of the interacting molecules occurs which leads to delocalized vibrations of all the molecules in the cluster. The second order correction of the vibrational excitation frequencies are found to be dominated by the intramolecular couplings of the normal modes due to the cubic anharmonicity of the force field. The procedures developed here are applied for the interpretation of vibrational photodissociation spectra of small methanol clusters in the region of the fundamental excitation frequency of the OH stretching mode (ν1, 3681.5 cm−1), the CH3 rocking mode (ν7, 1074.5 cm−1), and the CO stretching mode (ν8, 1033.5 cm−1). Using semiempirical models for the intermolecular potential functions, splittings and positions of the experimental bands can well be explained. The nonequivalent positions of the two molecules in the linear dimer structure give rise to two different absorption frequencies for each of the three modes of the donor and the acceptor molecule, respectively. The trimer and tetramer spectrum with only one absorption band are in agreement with the existence of symmetric planar ring structures (C3h and C4h) for these species. The pentamer spectrum which also consists of one band is explained by the occurrence of three closely spaced frequencies of an asymmetric ring. The double peak structure in the hexamer spectra can be attributed to a distorted ring structure of S6 symmetry, while the occurrence of other energetically near-degenerate isomers can be ruled out by means of their spectra.},

Six different possible water dimers come in two broad categories, planar and non-planar.

The linear dimer has the highest interaction energy, followed by the ring dimer and then comes the bifurcated dimer. For each of these type, a planar dimer having all six atoms organized in a single plane come very close to, but has a slightly higher energy than the corresponding non-planar counterpart. Bader’s atoms in molecules (AIM) theory, reduced density gradient (RDG) method and non-covalent interaction (NCI) analysis reveal that the electron density distribution among the interacting water molecules correlates exactly in the sequence of interaction energies of different isomers of water dimer.},

Recent results as well as an account of theoretical advances are presented for a series of important classes of compounds such as β-diketone enols, β-thioxoketone enols, Mannich bases, proton sponges, quinoline N-oxides and diacid anions. The O···O distance has long been used as a parameter for hydrogen bond strength in O–H···O systems. On a broad scale, a correlation between OH stretching wavenumbers and O···O distances is observed, as demonstrated experimentally as well as theoretically, but for substituted β-diketone enols this correlation is relatively weak.},

  abstract = {Given a family of nearly commuting symmetric matrices, we consider the task of computing an orthogonal matrix that nearly diagonalizes every matrix in the family. In this paper, we propose and analyze randomized joint diagonalization (RJD) for performing this task. RJD applies a standard eigenvalue solver to random linear combinations of the matrices. Unlike existing optimization-based methods, RJD is simple to implement and leverages existing high-quality linear algebra software packages. Our main novel contribution is to prove robust recovery: Given a family that is \$ε\$-near to a commuting family, RJD jointly diagonalizes this family, with high probability, up to an error of norm O(\$ε\$). We also discuss how the algorithm can be further improved by deflation techniques and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance by numerical experiments with synthetic and real-world data.},

The calculations were carried out by the vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) approximation, with corrections for correlations between the modes by perturbation theory. This correlation corrected VSCF (CC-VSCF) is analogous to the familiar Möller–Plesset method in electronic structure theory. Test calculations indicate that this method is of very good accuracy also for very anharmonic systems. While the method is of highest relative accuracy for the stiffest modes, it works very well also for the soft ones. Some of the main results are (1) the frequencies calculated are in good but incomplete agreement with experimental data available for some of the intramolecular mode excitations. The deviations are attributed to the inaccuracy of the coupling between intramolecular and intermolecular modes for the potential function used. (2) Insight is gained into the pattern of blue- or redshifts from the corresponding harmonic excitation energies for the various modes. (3) Anharmonic coupling between the modes dominates in general over the intrinsic anharmonicity of individual modes in determining the spectrum. (4) The anharmonic corrections to the frequencies of some intermolecular modes (shearing, torsional) are extremely large, and exceed 100\% or more in many cases. (5) An approximation of quartic potential field in the normal mode displacement is tested for the clusters. It works well for the high and intermediate frequency modes, but is in error for very soft shearing and torsional modes. (6) The relative errors of the VSCF approximation are found to decrease with the cluster size. This is extremely encouraging for calculations of large clusters, since the VSCF level is computationally simple.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Modern vibrational spectroscopy is more than just an analytical tool. Information about the electronic structure of a molecule, the strength of its bonds, and its conformational flexibility is encoded in the normal vibrational modes. On the other hand, normal vibrational modes are generally delocalized, which hinders the direct access to this information, attainable only via local vibration modes and associated local properties. Konkoli and Cremer provided an ingenious solution to this problem by deriving local vibrational modes from the fundamental normal modes, obtained in the harmonic approximation of the potential, via mass‐decoupled Euler–Lagrange equations. This review gives a general introduction into the local vibrational mode theory of Konkoli and Cremer, elucidating how this theory unifies earlier attempts to obtain easy to interpret chemical information from vibrational spectroscopy: (a) the local mode theory furnishes bond strength descriptors derived from force constant matrices with a physical basis, (b) provides the highly sought after extension of the Badger rule to polyatomic molecules, (c) and offers a simpler way to derive localized vibrations compared to the complex route via overtone spectroscopy. Successful applications are presented, including a new measure of bond strength, a new detailed analysis of infrared/Raman spectra, and the recent extension to periodic systems, opening a new avenue for the characterization of bonding in crystals. At the end of this review the LMODEA software is introduced, which performs the local mode analysis (with minimal computational costs) after a harmonic vibrational frequency calculation optionally using measured frequencies as additional input.

The ab initio data points were fitted to obtain a global potential energy surface for the complex. The equilibrium geometry of the complex corresponds to the formation of a hydrogen bond with water acting as a proton acceptor and a binding energy of De = 3059 cm−1 (8.75 kcal/mol). The energies and wavefunctions of the lowest bound states of the complex were computed using a variational approach, and the dissociation energies of both ortho-H2O–HF (D0 = 2089.4 cm−1 or 5.97 kcal/mol) and para-H2O–HF (D0 = 2079.6 cm−1 or 5.95 kcal/mol) were obtained.

  abstract = {Arising from the harmonic approximation in solving the vibrational Schrödinger equation, normal modes dissect molecular vibrations into distinct degrees of freedom. Normal modes are widely used as they give rise to descriptive vibrational notations and are convenient for expanding anharmonic potential energy surfaces as an alternative to higher-order Taylor series representations. Usually, normal modes are expressed in Cartesian coordinates, which bears drawbacks that can be overcome by switching to internal coordinates. Considering vibrational notations, normal modes with delocalized characters are difficult to denote, but internal coordinates offer a route to clearer notations. Based on the Hessian, normal mode decomposition schemes for a given set of internal coordinates can describe a normal mode by its contributions from internal coordinates. However, choosing a set of internal coordinates is not straightforward. While the Hessian provides unique sets of normal modes, various internal coordinate sets are possible for a given system. In the present work, we employ a normal mode decomposition scheme to choose an optimal set. Therefore, we screen reasonable sets based on topology and symmetry considerations and rely on a metric that minimizes coupling between internal coordinates. Ultimately, the Nomodeco toolkit presented here generates internal coordinate sets to find an optimal set for representing molecular vibrations. The resulting contribution tables can be used to clarify vibrational notations. We test our scheme on small to mid-sized molecules, showing how the space of definable internal coordinate sets can significantly be reduced.},

Density Functional Theory (DFT) in its classical formulations was applied to develop static models describing intermolecular hydrogen bond (HB) and isotope effect in the gas phase and using solvent reaction field reproduced by Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM). The Atoms in Molecules (AIM) theory enabled electronic structure and molecular topology study. The Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT) was used for energy decomposition in the dimers of n-octanol. Finally, time-evolution methods, namely classical molecular dynamics (MD) and Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics (CPMD) were employed to shed light onto dynamical nature of liquid n-octanol with emphasis put on metric and vibrational features. As a reference, CPMD gas phase results were applied.

  abstract = {In geometry optimizations and molecular dynamics calculations, it is often necessary to transform a geometry step that has been determined in internal coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. A new method for performing such transformations, the high‐order path‐expansion (HOPE) method, is here presented. The new method treats the nonlinear relation between internal and Cartesian coordinates by means of automatic differentiation. The method is reliable, applicable to any system of internal coordinates, and computationally more efficient than the traditional method of iterative back transformations. As a bonus, the HOPE method determines not just the Cartesian step vector but also a continuous step path expressed in the form of a polynomial, which is useful for determining reaction coordinates, for integrating trajectories, and for visualization. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

However, questions remain over the extent to which such damage is influenced by the nature of the surrounding chemical environment, which can consist of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains. To gain fundamental insight into the first crucial mechanistic steps of radiation damage in such systems, we need to understand the initial radiation response,               i.e.               dynamics occurring on the same timescale as electronic relaxation, which occur in these different environments. Amphiphilic molecules contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains, but the propensity for charge delocalisation and proton dynamics to occur in these different domains has been largely unexplored so far. Here, we present carbon and oxygen 1s Auger spectra for liquid methanol, one of the simplest amphiphilic molecules, as well as its fully deuterated equivalent d4-methanol, in order to explore X-ray induced charge delocalisation and proton dynamics occurring on the few femtosecond timescale. Unexpectedly, we find a similar propensity for proton dynamics to occur at both the carbon and oxygen site within the lifetime of the core hole. Our results could serve as a model for decay processes that are likely to occur in other more complex amphiphilic systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We present a new scheme for the geometry optimization of equilibrium and transition state structures that can be used for both strong and weak coordinates. We use a screening function that depends on atom‐pair distances to differentiate strong coordinates from weak coordinates. This differentiation significantly accelerates the optimization of these coordinates, and thus of the overall geometry. An adapted version of the delocalized coordinates setup is used to generate automatically a set of internal coordinates that is shown to perform well for the geometry optimization of systems with weak and strong coordinates. For the Baker test set of 30 molecules, we need only 173 geometry cycles with PW91/TZ2P calculations, which compares well with the best previous attempts reported in literature. For the localization of transition state structures, we generate the initial Hessian matrix, using appropriate force constants from a database. In this way, one avoids the explicit computation of the Hessian matrix. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2006},

Here, we review how the experimental and theoretical progress of the past decades has improved our understanding of water dimer vibrational spectroscopy under both cold and warm conditions. We focus on the intramolecular OH-stretching transitions of the donor unit, because these are the ones mostly affected by dimer formation and because their assignment has proven a challenge. We review cold experimental results from early matrix isolation to recent mass-selected jet expansion techniques and, in parallel, the improvements in the theoretical anharmonic models. We discuss and illustrate changes in the vibrational spectra of complexes upon increasing temperature, and the difficulties in recording and calculating these spectra. In the atmosphere, water dimer spectra at ambient temperature are crucial.},
